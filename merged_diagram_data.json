The process begins with an input image passed into a pretrained teacher model, which generates intermediate embeddings. These embeddings are processed by several RDMs, each simulating a teacher assistant by applying a different level of information constraint (e.g., high, medium, low). The resulting outputs supervise the student model. To prevent overfitting from multiple supervision signals, the student includes an IBM during training. Each RDM consists of an encoder, a noise injection mechanism, and a decoder that reconstructs the embedding.\nPlease generate:\n\t1.\tA visual diagram showing how these components interact.\n\t2.\tA separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure.

In CIFD, we explore the idea of Rate-Distortion Modules (RDM) that use the Teacher's embeddings to generate embeddings that act like Teacher Assistants (TAs) to distill knowledge to the Student. It does so by processing the embedding through a rate constrained communication channel. RDMs are much cheaper to train as they reuse the feature extractors learned by the teacher. By varying the rate constraint, RDMs can can simulate different TAs, and enable \"TA\" based training.",

In the first stage, an input image is passed through a frozen teacher backbone model to generate intermediate embeddings. A trainable RDM then reconstructs these embeddings via an encoder–noise–decoder architecture. The RDM is trained using two objectives: mean squared error (MSE) between its output and the teacher embedding, and a rate loss that penalizes information flow through the bottleneck. The total loss is the sum of these two terms. In the second stage, the student model is trained using both the teacher and the pre-trained RDMs. The student backbone model produces an embedding which is passed through an Information Bottleneck Module (IBM), composed of an encoder, noise injection, and a decoder. The student embedding is compared to both the teacher and RDM embeddings. The training objective includes MSE losses with respect to both, as well as the rate loss from IBM. The total loss aggregates all three terms.\nPlease generate:\n\t1.\tA visual diagram showing how these components interact.\n\t2.\tA separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure.

The local SLAM process involves two modules: (1) Tracking – estimating the agent's trajectory in real time, and (2) Mapping – constructing the local sub-map. Once a new sub-map is initiated, the agent sends the previous sub-map and its corresponding image features to the centralized server.\n\nOn the **Server Side**, the system receives sub-maps and image features from all agents and stores them. It then performs three key operations:\n- Loop Detection and Registration: Detects overlapping regions across agents' sub-maps.\n- Pose Graph Optimization: Refines pose estimations using loop constraints to improve consistency.\n- Sub-map Merging and Refinement: All sub-maps are merged into a globally consistent map, which is further refined and updated.\n\nThe server sends back optimized pose updates to the agents after each refinement step. Green arrows indicate synchronization and merged outputs.\n\nPlease generate:\n 1. A clear architectural diagram showing the two main components (Agent Side and Server Side) and their interactions.\n 2. A separate caption summarizing the figure.

These compression methods introduce substantial information loss. The compressed vision tokens \\( \\text{compress}(\\mathcal{V}) \\) are then processed by the LLM alongside text tokens \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) to generate the output probability \\( p(y|\\text{compress}(\\mathcal{V}), \\mathcal{T}) \\).\n\n**(b) VoCo-LLaMA**:\nInstead of relying on external compression modules, VoCo-LLaMA introduces an intrinsic **token distillation** mechanism. It enables the LLM itself to perform compression and understanding of vision tokens using a **VoCo** component. The framework directly processes raw vision tokens \\( \\mathcal{V} \\) and text tokens \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) through VoCo and LLM, yielding improved output probability \\( p_{LM}(y|LM(\\mathcal{V}, \\text{VoCo}), \\mathcal{T}) \\).\n\nPlease generate:\n 1.

The result is a visually imagined proxy that aligns better with the intended query semantics.\n2. **Balanced Proxy Retrieval** – In this stage, the proxy image and reference image are encoded by CLIP, and their features are fused with semantic perturbations. The composed features are balanced and then used for similarity selection, improving retrieval robustness over text-only methods.\nPlease generate:\n 1. A clear and structured diagram showing both components, with proper module names (e.g., BLIP2, LLM, MGC++, CLIP, etc.) and directional arrows.\n 2. A caption summarizing The image’s purpose and flow.

A **linear projection** maps each limb’s features to **tokens**; **morphology tokens** (e.g., limb type, degree, parent index) are prepended/added to condition the model on structure. Stacked **Transformer blocks** perform cross-limb attention to fuse information across the morphology. The resulting limb tokens feed **action heads**, yielding **limb-specific actions** (e.g., torques or target poses).\n**(b) Centralized Batch Processing.** Agents with different morphologies (e.g., biped, quadruped, arachnid) are **padded to a common max token length** and accompanied by an **attention/masking scheme** so padded tokens do not participate in attention. A **single shared-weight MoSAT** processes the entire batch on GPU, producing per-limb actions for each agent. Actions are **un-padded/routed** back to their corresponding environments, which return next observations and rewards, enabling efficient parallel RL rollouts across heterogeneous bodies.\n",

It introduces two core modules: (1) Language-Aligned Positional Embedding (LAPE), which embeds coordinate special tokens (<t>, <w>, <h>) directly into the visual feature space, reducing the difficulty of cross-modal coordinate alignment; (2) Spatial-Temporal Packer (STP), which compresses video features along spatial and temporal dimensions separately with point-to-region attention, preserving fine-grained details. Together, LAPE and STP enable efficient video compression and precise spatio-temporal localization. The model is trained with the large-scale ST-Align dataset (4.3M samples), covering diverse tasks such as Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG), Event Localization and Captioning (ELC), and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). This framework achieves state-of-the-art results across 11 multimodal benchmarks.\nPlease generate:\n\t1.\tA diagram showing the integration of LAPE and STP within LLaVA-ST, highlighting input embeddings (images, video, text, and special tokens), the compression streams, and the final unified pretrained LLM.\n\t2.\tA separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure.

A projection layer maps embeddings into tokens for the LLM.

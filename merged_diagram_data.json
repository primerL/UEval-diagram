    "prompt": "I am preparing a figure for my paper to illustrate the following framework:\nThe CIFD framework distills knowledge from a teacher to a student by introducing two key components: a set of Rate-Distortion Modules (RDMs) and an Information Bottleneck Module (IBM). The process begins with an input image passed into a pretrained teacher model, which generates intermediate embeddings. These embeddings are processed by several RDMs, each simulating a teacher assistant by applying a different level of information constraint (e.g., high, medium, low). The resulting outputs supervise the student model. To prevent overfitting from multiple supervision signals, the student includes an IBM during training. Each RDM consists of an encoder, a noise injection mechanism, and a decoder that reconstructs the embedding. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure. Please provide the image and caption separately.",
    "text_ref": "Proposed: Controlled Information Flow for Knowledge Distillation (CIFD). In CIFD, we explore the idea of Rate-Distortion Modules (RDM) that use the Teacher's embeddings to generate embeddings that act like Teacher Assistants (TAs) to distill knowledge to the Student. It does so by processing the embedding through a rate constrained communication channel. RDMs are much cheaper to train as they reuse the feature extractors learned by the teacher. By varying the rate constraint, RDMs can simulate different TAs, and enable \"TA\" based training.",

In the first stage, an input image is passed through a frozen teacher backbone model to generate intermediate embeddings. A trainable RDM then reconstructs these embeddings via an encoder–noise–decoder architecture. The RDM is trained using two objectives: mean squared error (MSE) between its output and the teacher embedding, and a rate loss that penalizes information flow through the bottleneck. The total loss is the sum of these two terms. In the second stage, the student model is trained using both the teacher and the pre-trained RDMs. The student backbone model produces an embedding which is passed through an Information Bottleneck Module (IBM), composed of an encoder, noise injection, and a decoder. The student embedding is compared to both the teacher and RDM embeddings. The training objective includes MSE losses with respect to both, as well as the rate loss from IBM. The total loss aggregates all three terms. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure.

The patch embedding layer converts raw image regions into learnable patch tokens and enhances them using localized cross-attention. Special tokens like <CLS> and <SPL> are added to maintain global context and preserve spatial segmentation. These enriched tokens are then flattened and passed through a feed-forward network before entering the decoder. During training, a patch aligning layer supervises the quality of visual features by aligning EVE's outputs with those from a frozen vision encoder. This involves reshaping patch tokens, applying layer-wise attention, and using an MSE loss to align the representations at the patch level. Tokens such as <CLS> and padding are removed as needed to match the reference features. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2.

It decomposes the process into modular stages that simulate how humans might approach diagram construction. The framework handles three types of tasks: Diagram Generation: A user provides a natural language instruction describing a diagram to be created from scratch. Diagram Coding: The system reverse-engineers structured code from a given diagram image. Diagram Editing: A user modifies an existing diagram by providing revision instructions. The process begins when the Plan Agent receives a user query. It parses the instruction and expands it into a more explicit query detailing the required visual components (e.g., input/output nodes, layer types, layout constraints). This planning phase utilizes an LLM to assign sub-tasks. The expanded query is routed to either the Code Agent, which generates diagram code from the detailed instruction, or to the Diagram-to-Code Agent, which reconstructs code from visual inputs. The Check Agent performs code verification, debugging, and feedback. The agent ensures the output is valid and interpretable, and facilitates iteration when errors occur. The entire system supports end-to-end generation from instruction to rendered diagram, including code-based feedback and visual output comparison. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure. Please provide the image and caption separately.",

The local SLAM process involves two modules: (1) Tracking – estimating the agent's trajectory in real time, and (2) Mapping – constructing the local sub-map. Once a new sub-map is initiated, the agent sends the previous sub-map and its corresponding image features to the centralized server.\n\nOn the **Server Side**, the system receives sub-maps and image features from all agents and stores them. It then performs three key operations:\n- Loop Detection and Registration: Detects overlapping regions across agents' sub-maps.\n- Pose Graph Optimization: Refines pose estimations using loop constraints to improve consistency.\n- Sub-map Merging and Refinement: All sub-maps are merged into a globally consistent map, which is further refined and updated.\n\nThe server sends back optimized pose updates to the agents after each refinement step. Green arrows indicate synchronization and merged outputs. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure. Please provide the image and caption separately.",

It then updates the stored sub-maps and returns the optimized poses to the agents. Once the algorithm completes (denoted by green arrows), the server merges the accumulated sub-maps into a single unified map and refines it.",

This can lead to two pathways: **Code Generation**, where the agent synthesizes `pptx` code programmatically, or **Image Generation**, a baseline method that visually generates the slide without code. The outputs are then compared against a **Reference Slide** in the **Slide Evaluation** stage using two protocols:\n\n1.  **Reference-Free Evaluation**: This method assesses various aspects like image quality, text coherence, color aesthetics, and layout effectiveness independently, without a ground-truth reference slide.\n2.  **Reference-Based Evaluation**: This protocol meticulously compares generated slides against the reference slide, measuring element matching, content accuracy, color fidelity, and spatial positioning of elements.",

These compression methods introduce substantial information loss. The compressed vision tokens \\( \\text{compress}(\\mathcal{V}) \\) are then processed by the LLM alongside text tokens \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) to generate the output probability \\( p(y|\\text{compress}(\\mathcal{V}), \\mathcal{T}) \\).\n\n**(b) VoCo-LLaMA**:\nInstead of relying on external compression modules, VoCo-LLaMA introduces an intrinsic **token distillation** mechanism. It enables the LLM itself to perform compression and understanding of vision tokens using a **VoCo** component. The framework directly processes raw vision tokens \\( \\mathcal{V} \\) and text tokens \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) through VoCo and LLM, yielding improved output probability \\( p_{LM}(y|LM(\\mathcal{V}, \\text{VoCo}), \\mathcal{T}) \\).

These compressed tokens, along with text tokens (\\(\\mathcal{T}\\)), are then processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce an output probability \\(p(y|\\text{compress}(\\mathcal{V}), \\mathcal{T})\\).

When encoding long video sequences directly without compression, only a portion of the video tokens fit within the LLM’s context window. The remaining content is truncated, and thus lost, limiting the model’s ability to process extended video sequences.\n\n**(b) VoCo-LLaMA**:\nThis subfigure illustrates how VoCo-LLaMA overcomes this limitation by segmenting the video input into multiple clips (\\(\\mathcal{V}_1, \\mathcal{V}_2, ..., \\mathcal{V}_k\\)), encoding each into compact representations \\(\\text{VoCo}_1, \\text{VoCo}_2, ..., \\text{VoCo}_k\\), and caching them across sequential LM modules.

The result is a visually imagined proxy that aligns better with the intended query semantics.\n2. **Balanced Proxy Retrieval** – In this stage, the proxy image and reference image are encoded by CLIP, and their features are fused with semantic perturbations. The composed features are balanced and then used for similarity selection, improving retrieval robustness over text-only methods. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure. Please provide the image and caption separately.",

Simultaneously, a diffusion process initiates from Gaussian noise, progressing through iterative steps ($z_T$ to $\\hat{z}_0$) guided by `AlignOp` (means/variances) to produce an early prediction ($\\hat{z}_0$). **Stage 2: Guided Refinement** takes this early prediction and refines it through a process guided by the transmission-aware weight map and an MS-SSIM loss function. The core of this refinement is the **Density-aware Fidelity Guidance** equation: $L_1 AccSamp = T(I) \\cdot || \\hat{h}_1 - I(I) ||_2 + \\lambda_1 \\cdot (1 - MS-SSIM(\\hat{h}_1, \\hat{I}_3))$, where $T(I)$ represents the transmission estimate, $\\hat{h}_1$ is the refined image, $I(I)$ is the input image, and $\\hat{I}_3$ is the final dehazed output.

Three image-scanpath pairs (positive, anchor, negative) are processed by a shared feature extractor F, which extracts relevant features from the input. These features are then fed into two main modules: the CSE Module and the USD Module. The CSE Module is responsible for encoding task and duration features, which are crucial for understanding the context and timing of scanpaths. The USD Module utilizes cross-attention to compute subject embeddings, capturing the unique characteristics of each individual's scanpath behavior. Finally, the UP Module employs a triplet loss to supervise the learning of subject-specific embeddings, ensuring that the model can differentiate between individuals. On the right, detailed breakdowns of the CSE and USD modules illustrate their internal mechanisms, including task/language encoding, self-attention mechanisms, and feed-forward networks (FFN) that contribute to their overall functionality.",

A **linear projection** maps each limb’s features to **tokens**; **morphology tokens** (e.g., limb type, degree, parent index) are prepended/added to condition the model on structure. Stacked **Transformer blocks** perform cross-limb attention to fuse information across the morphology. The resulting limb tokens feed **action heads**, yielding **limb-specific actions** (e.g., torques or target poses).\n**(b) Centralized Batch Processing.** Agents with different morphologies (e.g., biped, quadruped, arachnid) are **padded to a common max token length** and accompanied by an **attention/masking scheme** so padded tokens do not participate in attention. A **single shared-weight MoSAT** processes the entire batch on GPU, producing per-limb actions for each agent. Actions are **un-padded/routed** back to their corresponding environments, which return next observations and rewards, enabling efficient parallel RL rollouts across heterogeneous bodies.\n",

I need a figure to illustrate my framework named **CityWalker**, which enables learning navigation from large-scale videos. My method includes:\n\n1. A training pipeline that processes **video frames** and **relative poses** from visual odometry to extract past observations, trajectories, and target coordinates.\n2. An **image encoder** (frozen) and a **coordinate encoder** (MLP) that generate tokens for each input.\n3. A **transformer** that processes tokens to predict future observations.\n4. **Action and arrival heads** that decode the outputs for embodied control.\n5. During training, we also encode future frames to supervise future token hallucination. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure. Please provide the image and caption separately.",

At each time step, the model receives past observations, past trajectory, and target location as input. They are encoded via a frozen image encoder and a trainable coordinate encoder. A transformer processes these inputs to generate future tokens. An action head and an arrival head decode these tokens into action and arrival status predictions. During training, future frame tokens from future frames guide the transformer to hallucinate future tokens.",

The DSS pipeline uses a large language model (e.g., GPT) to extract interpretable attribute concepts for each class. These attributes are organized into a concepts bank. During training, the model computes Concept Activation Scores (CAS) between visual features and the concept bank. These are then weighted and aggregated by category to perform classification via cross-entropy loss. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2.

CritiQ Flow involves a Manager agent that evolves criteria and Worker agents that perform multi-criteria pairwise judgments, guided by a knowledge base.

Together, LAPE and STP enable efficient video compression and precise spatio-temporal localization. The model is trained with the large-scale ST-Align dataset (4.3M samples), covering diverse tasks such as Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG), Event Localization and Captioning (ELC), and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG).

A projection layer maps embeddings into tokens for the LLM.

    "prompt": "I am preparing a figure for my paper to illustrate the following framework:\nURWKV (Unified RWKV with Multi-state Perspective) is an encoder-decoder model designed for low-light image restoration and coupled degradation handling. The core is the URWKV block, which includes two sub-blocks: (1) multi-state spatial mixing and (2) multi-state channel mixing. The model introduces Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that dynamically adjusts normalization using inter-stage states for scene-aware luminance modulation. It also integrates a Multi-state Quad-directional Token Shift (SQ-Shift) to capture both long-range dependencies and local variations. Additionally, a State-aware Selective Fusion (SSF) module aggregates and selectively fuses multi-state features across encoder stages, reducing noise propagation and enhancing contextual alignment. The decoder reconstructs enhanced images from these fused representations. This design enables flexible, efficient, and robust restoration under dynamically coupled degradations. Please generate: 1. A visual diagram showing how these components interact. 2. A separate caption summarizing the key idea of the figure. Please provide the image and caption separately.",
